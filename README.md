# Bilis, Baybayin!

QuickDraw but for Baybayin scripts. 

The Philippines has gradually lost its cultural richness over hundreds of years of colonization by four different superpowers of their time.
One of the remnants of our old cultures is the Baybayin script. Sadly, the majority of Filipinos are unfamiliar with it.
We developed Bilis, Baybayin! as (1) a learning tool to make studying Baybayin more fun, especially for the kids, and 
(2) a data collection platform which we could then use to further improve our machine learning models.
